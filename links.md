### Introduction

Links are the glue holding the web together, so make sure you understand how to properly link to external websites AND internal files.

Links are used in nearly all web pages. Links let users click their way from page to page.

## HTML Links

HTML links are hyperlinks, You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

> **Note:** A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

## HTML Links - Syntax

Hyperlinks are defined with the HTML `<a>` tag:

`<a href="url">link text</a>`

---

Example

`<a href="https://www.mylink.com/html/">Visit our HTML course</a>`

## Internal and external links

The example above used an absolute URL (a full web address).

A local link (link to the same web site - internal) is specified with a relative URL (without https://www....).

Example

`<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a>`
